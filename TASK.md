- build a shopware 6 plugin that adds the possibility to attach documents (like user-manual.pdf) to a product and displays download links on the product detail storefront page.
- the plugin will be primarily used by an external e-commerce solution which populates a shopware6 shop with products. These products can have pdf files attached.
- the plugin should have an (minimal) admin and a frontend part.
